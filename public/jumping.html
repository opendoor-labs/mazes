    <h1>Jumping</h1>
    <p>Ziyad wants to know how good you are at long jumping.</p>
    <p>The format of the input is a multiline string representing the distances that you can jump forward from a given index.</p>
    <p>The solution you should provide is the sequence of jump distances (starting from the first position) that you must jump in order to make it to the end of the long jump pit (last index).</p>
    <p>When you request a jumping distance path, you will get back a JSON object containing two fields:
      <code>input</code> and <code>solve_url</code>. <code>input</code> is the string representation of the
      jumping distance path. <code>solve_url</code> is where you will post your solution to get the next jumping distance path.</p>
    <p>When you attempt solve a jumping distance path, you will get back a JSON object containing two fields:
      <code>result</code> and either <code>message</code> or <code>next_url</code>.
      <code>result</code> will be either "completed" or "failure". If the jumping distance path is "completed", then
      <code>next_url</code> will contain the URL to get the next jumping distance path. If that was the last jumping distance path,
      instead of a URL, you will get back a <code>message</code>. If the jumping distance path is "failed", then
      <code>message</code> will be a message telling you why your solution did not complete the jumping distance path.</p>
    <p>The format for requesting a jumping distance path is to make a <code>GET</code> request to
      <code>/levels/:name/:stage</code>. The first stage is
      <a href='/levels/jumping'>jumping</a>.
    <p>The format for attempting to solve a jumping distance path is to make a <code>PUT</code> request to the
      <code>solve_url</code>, appending your solution as an additional param called
      <code>solution</code>, either as a query param or in the body as well as a secret token. For example, you could make a
      <code>PUT</code> to <code>/levels/:name/:stage/solve?solution=:solution&token=:token</code></p>
    <p>Good luck!</p>
